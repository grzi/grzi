### Who am I ?

I'm a simple passionate developer from @Zenika. I'm mainly working on Java, Rust, C#, JS (React and VueJs). I worked a lot with Kafka but for now I'm just a hobbyist until I switch mission. I also like Kubernetes, and cloud solutions (GCP and Azure devops). Moreover, I like Github action and often try to learn it.
